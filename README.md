# [Volume Calculation Sphere Drawing](https://hamutalg.github.io/VolumeCalculationSphereDrawing/)
#### JavaScript - HTML - CSS3

A one-page webpage that is used to calculate (and draw) the volume of a sphere from a radius input.
The page includes 2 simple inputs: 
- Radius (written in by the user)
- Volume of the sphere (calculated upon clicking the "calculate" button)

The user cannot write in a non-numerical radius.  
The measured sphere will be shown on the canvas upon calculation.  
The circumference of the circle cannot surpass the inner border of the canvas.   
The user may clear the canvas by clicking on the "clear" button below the canvas.  

The project is written using:

  - HTML5, Bootstrap
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript
